  # -- Uncomment the following to create jobs that purposely fail validation (for testing).  Here's a sample hash explaining why.
  # "jobP" => {"duration" => 15,   "dependencies" => [],        "description" => ""},   # 1. Duplicate job name
  # "jobQ" => {"duration" => 15,   "dependencies" => ["jobQ"],  "description" => ""},   # 2. Dependency of self
  # "jobR" => {"duration" => 15,   "dependencies" => ["nope"],  "description" => ""},   # 5. Dependencies must exist in schedule.
  # "jobS" => {                    "dependencies" => [],        "description" => ""},   # 6. Duration key must exist.
  # "jobT" => {"duration" => 0,    "dependencies" => [],        "description" => ""},   # 6. Duration must be greater than 0.
